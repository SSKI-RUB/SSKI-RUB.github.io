                                    Cosentyx in
                                    reducing the severity and area of the body affected by the condition, which causes

                                    Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday its drug Tremfya was more effective than a rival
                                    medicine from Novartis AG, and met the main goal of a late-stage study in adults
                                    with
                                    moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The study involving 1,048 participants showed Tremfya was superior to Novartis'
                                    Cosentyx in

                                    dry,
                                    flaky and itchy skin patches, J&J said.
                                    <br><br>
                                    After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the patients treated with Tremfya showed
                                    90
                                    percent improvement in disease symptoms, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity
                                    Index
                                    (PASI), while only 70 percent of those treated with Cosentyx showed similar results.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, J&J said Tremfya was not superior to Cosentyx in demonstrating quicker
                                    effectiveness.

                                    Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells,
                                    resulting
                                    in inflamed, red lesions or plaques, which can be itchy and painful.

                                    About 7.5 million Americans live with plaque psoriasis, of which 20 percent have
                                    moderate to
                                    severe form of the disease, the company said.

                                    Tremfya, first approved in July 2017 as a plaque psoriasis treatment in the U.S., is
                                    also
                                    being tested as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease.

                                    Cosentyx, which has been approved in the U.S. for plaque psoriasis, scalp psoriasis
                                    and
