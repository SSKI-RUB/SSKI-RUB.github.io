                                    The study involving 1,048 participants showed Tremfya was superior to Novartis'

                                    After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the patients treated with Tremfya showed

                                    Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells,

                                    The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic
                                    lesions and

                                    response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the
                                    head,
                                    trunk,
                                    upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately
                                    for the
                                    percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges
                                    from 0
                                    (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema,
                                    induration, and
                                    scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric
                                    score that
                                    could
                                    range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease.

                                J&J says its psoriasis drug superior to Novartis treatment in study
                            </h6>

                                    Johnson & Johnson said its drug, Tremfya, was found to be more effective than a
                                    rival medicine from Novartis AG in reducing the severity and affected area in adults
                                    with
                                    moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in a late-stage study.
                                    <br><br>
                                    After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the 1,048 participants treated with
                                    Tremfya
                                    showed 90 percent improvement in disease symptoms, as measured by the Psoriasis Area
                                    Severity Index, compared with 70 percent on Novartis’s Cosentyx, J&J said.
                                    <br><br>
                                    J&J is positioning Tremfya as a better alternative to Cosentyx as it seeks to take
                                    market
                                    share away from Novartis’s drug, which was launched two years ago and is among the
                                    top-selling treatments in the $11 billion global psoriasis market.
                                    <br><br>
                                    That market is expected to double to $21.11 billion by 2022, according to U.S.
                                    consultant
                                    Grand View Research.
                                    <br><br>
                                    With $2.1 billion in sales in 2017, Cosentyx has become one of the top revenue
                                    earners for
                                    Novartis and is expected to make up for falling revenue from its blood cancer
                                    treatment,
                                    Gleevec, whose patent expired two years ago.
                                    <br><br>
                                    On a media briefing following the release of J&J’s trial results, Novartis said it
                                    expected
                                    the data to have “limited clinical relevance” and no impact on plans to expand the
                                    Cosentyx
                                    label.
                                    <br><br>
                                    J&J also said Cosentyx demonstrated quicker effectiveness than Tremfya during the
                                    study.
                                    <br><br>
                                    “These results imply that Cosentyx remains a good option for moderate-to-severe
                                    psoriasis
                                    patients that want to achieve more rapid skin clearance,” brokerage Jefferies wrote
                                    in a
                                    note following the results.
                                    <br><br>
                                    “We see Cosentyx secure as a mainstay psoriasis therapy.”

                                    Psoriasis is a chronic condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells,
                                    resulting in
                                    inflamed, red lesions or plaques, which can be itchy and painful.

                                    About 7.5 million Americans live with plaque psoriasis, of which 20 percent have
                                    moderate-to-severe form of the disease, J&J said.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Tremfya, first approved in July 2017 as a plaque psoriasis treatment in the United
                                    States,
                                    is also being tested as a for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease.

                                    Shares of J&J closed up marginally at $148. U.S.-listed shares of Novartis closed up
